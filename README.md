# YouTube Metadata Machine learning Research Project | COSC526 @ UTK

## Motivation
* Assist individuals seeking success on the YouTube platform by identifying the key variables that determine a video and channel's success.
* Utilize **predictive modeling techniques**, such as **linear regression** and **decision trees** to identify the critical variables that play the most significant roles in determining success in channel and vidoes.

## Dataset
[YouTube Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/revealing-insights-from-youtube-video-and-channe)

## Methodology
* **Data Collection** - Dataset from Kaggle
* **Preprocessing** - Pandas python library
* **Feature Selection** - Visualizations and identifying correlations
    - **Regression Techniques** - Linear and Multiple Regression Tecnniques
    - **Classification Techniques** - Decision Trees/Random Forest from scikit-learn library
* **Evaluation** - Model accuracies
